As the House voted to impeach him, President Trump gleefully taunted Democrats Wednesday night in a wild rally before thousands of supporters who lined up in the bitter Michigan cold to see him create one of the more stunning split-screen moments of his presidency. Back in Washington, House Democrats adopted two articles of impeachment related to his pressure campaign on Ukraine to launch political investigations. Simultaneously, at his \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d rally in Battle Creek, Mich., Trump sounded an almost-victorious note as he essentially argued that Democrats would rue the day. \"By the way, it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached,\" Trump opened his nearly two-hour speech. \"The country is doing better than ever before. We've done nothing wrong.\" \"The do-nothing Democrats,\u00a0and they are do nothing, are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for [the] American voter\" with the impeachment process, Trump said. He called impeachment \"political suicide.\" \"Have you seen my poll numbers in the last four weeks?\" Trump added.\u00a0\"They've been trying to impeach me since before I\u00a0ran.\" <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-vote-imminent-as-trump-plans\" target=\"_blank\">WITH TRUMP IMPEACHMENT VOTE IMMINENT, PRESIDENT TRAVELING TO BATTLE CREEK, MICH., TO RALLY THE FAITHFUL</a></strong> A staffer interrupted the speech to inform Trump of the outcome of the impeachment vote, which was 229 in favor and 198 against the article to impeach Trump for obstruction of Congress, and a 230-197 vote to impeach him for abuse of power. Trump pointed out that not one Republican voted in favor of impeachment but three Democrats voted against it. \"The Republicans\u00a0have\u00a0never been so affronted but they've never been so united as they are right now,\" he said. \"I'm the first person to ever get impeached and there's no crime!\" Trump said, adding\u00a0that Democrats have \"cheapened\" the impeachment process. Trump slammed\u00a0House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as a \"pathological liar\" for the dramatized version of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump also mocked Schiff for his looks. \"With Me Too, I never even think about looks anymore, OK? I don't talk about looks of a male or female,\" Trump said. \"I'll say, just one last time, Schiff is\u00a0not exactly the best-looking guy.\" \"Didn't he have eight quid pro quos?\" Trump said of Schiff's version of his phone call that was read out on the House floor.\u00a0\"You say it eight times, they have you arrested they put you into an insane asylum.\" \"Democrats do not believe\u00a0you have the right to select your own president,\" Trump told the crowd. Trump said Democrats should not be allowed to hold an impeachment after the Russia investigation. \"Think of what they did, think of how dishonest it was -- they shouldn't even be allowed to hold an impeachment,\" he said. \"Comey, he\u2019s another beauty, did I\u00a0not do a great job when I fired his a--?\" Trump said. He said \"Trump haters\" cost taxpayers \"billions and billions\" of dollars in what didn't get done during the Mueller investigation. Trump said that Michigan has had the \"best year it's ever had\" due to auto companies \"expanding, thriving, coming in from Japan.\" \"I said, 'Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies? Why are you allowing them to come in from China?'\" Trump recounted from a previous speech in front of Michigan lawmakers. Trump touted the USMCA trade deal, which is expected to pass the House on Thursday as a replacement to\u00a0NAFTA. \"We had tremendous trade barriers with Canada, a tax on dairy products... nobody talked about it,\" he said. Trump blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D.-Calif., for the deal's delay, saying:\u00a0\"The deal has been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time. She had a lot of pressure from manufacturing farm areas.\" \"The Democrats try to take credit for this deal and that's okay, whatever it takes,\" Trump added. Two protesters held a sign\u00a0in the stands that read \"Don the Con you're fired;\" they received echoing boos and \"USA\" chants throughout the arena. \"There's a slob, a real slob. She\u2019ll get hell when she gets back home with mom,\" Trump chimed in. <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong> He pivoted back to trade with China.\u00a0\"China\u2019s paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. They never gave us ten cents,\" he said, adding that he was leaving many of the 25 percent tariffs, allowing for billions in subsidies to farmers. Trump claimed to make the largest investment in the U.S. military ever, saying his administration invested $738 million more on military equipment all made in the U.S. He said the nation was building the \"most powerful weapons in the world.\" \"You know the way we're, not going to have to use them, is if we have them,\" he said. Trump briefly turned to his potential Democratic opponents, saying that Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren had a big crowd in New York but his son Barron could go into Central Park and attract \"the same or a bigger crowd\" though he's 13. Trump said that at a \"big\" rally for former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden, 93 people would show up. \"I thought I knocked off Pocahantas, I did it a year too early,\" Trump said of Pete Buttigieg's surge to the top of the polls, as Warren did earlier in the race. \"Who wants to watch Buttigieg? It's an unpronouncable name.\" \"Boot-edge-edge, like the edge of a building,\" Trump added.", "authors": "Morgan Phillips", "title": "Trump taunts Dems at Michigan rally: 'Doesn't really feel like we're being impeached'"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-democrats-biden-booker-sanders-warren-buttigieg-gabbard-impeachment-reaction": {"content": " The Democrat-controlled\u00a0House of Representatives on Wednesday night adopted two articles of impeachment against President Trump, advancing them both to the Senate for a future trial,\u00a0but one notable 2020 Democratic presidential contender voted \"present\" -- rather than yay or nay. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tulsi-gabbard-votes-present-trump-impeachment-articles\" target=\"_blank\">Rep.

The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals by a 2-1 vote concluded the original law\u2019s key funding mechanism known as the individual mandate \u2014 requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty \u2014 was properly eliminated by Congress and therefore the entire law could not be enforced. The appeals panel sent the issue back to the lower court to decide whether other aspects of the Affordable Care Act must fall. The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans agreed with Texas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor\u2019s finding that the insurance requirement was rendered unconstitutional when, in 2017, Congress eliminated a tax penalty on people without insurance. \u201cThe individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cOn the severability question, we remand to the district court to provide additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA as they currently exist.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-approves-1-4-trillion-spending-bill-avoiding-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HOUSE APPROVES $1.4 TRILLION SPENDING BILL, REPEALING OBAMACARE TAXES\u00a0</strong></a> The appeals court concluded because the individual mandate was unconstitutional, the law\u2019s funding mechanism could not be enforced in the current version of the Affordable Care Act. Other parts of the law may survive, but the appeals court deferred to the lower court to decide the severability question \u2014whether the entire law must be struck down or what parts of the law could still exist.

Texas argued that due to the unlawfulness of the individual mandate, the entire ACA must be scrapped. \"It may still be that none of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate, even after this inquiry is concluded,\" Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod said in her majority opinion. \"It may be that all of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate.

The GOP fundraising underscores how Republicans have sought to turn the impeachment fight to their advantage, tapping into an outraged base to fuel not only the president's 2020 re-election effort but also a political\u00a0offensive against congressional Democrats.\u00a0Republicans are specifically using their November success to bolster their \u201cStop the Madness\u201d campaign,\u00a0a national counter-impeachment push targeting House Democrats that was launched in September.

Holder treated Congress with contempt and did everything he could to evade its oversight responsibilities by misleading, misinforming, and ignoring members of Congress and its committees.\u00a0 They reported that he filled the career ranks of the Justice Department with political allies, cronies, and Democratic Party donors, in what they believed were clear violations of civil service rules.\u00a0Many of those cronies and political hacks are still there and have been doing everything they can from inside DOJ to attack President Trump and get him removed from office. Holder treated Congress with contempt and did everything he could to evade its oversight responsibilities by misleading, misinforming, and ignoring members of Congress and its committees. He directed his Civil Rights Division to misuse discrimination laws to attack state efforts to improve the integrity of elections, doing everything he could to make it easier to commit voter fraud, which has occasionally facilitated the election of members of his own party. The former attorney general misused that same Division to restrict the First Amendment rights of pro-life protesters in prosecutions that were thrown out by judges, one of whom speculated that the meritless prosecution was the \u201cproduct\u201d of what amounted to a conspiracy between the government and the abortion clinic to shut down legal protests. Holder damaged our national security by insisting that terrorists be treated as ordinary domestic criminals.\u00a0He prosecuted the leakers of classified information in the lower levels of government but never went after his allies in the White House when they were caught leaking sensitive and classified information that benefited the public image of Barack Obama.\u00a0  Holder is apparently unconcerned over the Inspector General\u2019s report that showed that the FBI misled the FISA court, failing to inform the court of exculpatory information that conflicted with its claims, and omitting evidence that showed its primary source, Christopher Steele, was a liar and a con man who was working for the political campaign of Hillary Clinton. The same Hillary Clinton whom Holder \u2013 when he was the deputy attorney general in 1999 during the Clinton administration -- helped garner votes for in New York in her Senate run by helping to arrange the pardons of 16 unrepentant Puerto Rican terrorists, some of whom had carried out bombings, armed robberies, and murders.\u00a0 In other words, he politicized the pardon process in what former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy said were \u201cembarrassingly naked instances of justice succumbing to influence peddling.\u201d During his tenure as attorney general, Holder showed that he had no problem with the government spying on Americans when the Justice Department secretly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/us/phone-records-of-journalists-of-the-associated-press-seized-by-us.html\">seized</a> telephone records of Associated Press reporters.

Holder claims Barr gave an \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cnakedly partisan\u201d speech at the Federalist Society\u2019s annual lawyers\u2019 convention. We were at the convention and heard that speech. Apparently, Holder believes that giving an informed, learned speech about the views of the framers of the Constitution on how they drafted that document to provide for a strong executive is \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cnakedly partisan.\u201d Holder demonstrated during his tenure as attorney general that he believes in a \u201cliving\u201d Constitution that can be bent, twisted, broken or just plain ignored when needed to achieve his \u201cnakedly partisan\u201d political goals and to protect his president. It is no wonder that he is critical of an attorney general who actually believes in the rule of law and is forthright in enforcing the Constitution as it was written and intended regardless of partisan politics. Former Attorney General Ed Meese has long had a cardinal rule. He does not criticize the lawyers who hold that office out of respect for the office and the often very tough job of the attorney general.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., it was the repeated shouting of \"Stop it!\" when House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy recounted a profane remark about President Trump that fellow Squad member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., had uttered back in January. On Wednesday, several journalists -- including PBS Newshour senior reporter Daniel Bush, Daily Caller reporter Scott Morefield and others -- identified Omar,\u00a0who was not seen on camera\u00a0-- as the voice heard in the background as\u00a0McCarthy addressed his fellow House members in the U.S. Capitol. <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-tulsi-gabbard-present-vote-impeach-trump\" target=\"_blank\">AOC TAKES A SWIPE AT TULSI GABBARD'S 'PRESENT' VOTES</a></strong> \"What's the problem?\" Morefield wrote, referring to Omar. \"Truth hurt?\" In January -- soon after all four Squad members took office following their elections in November 2018, and months before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that kicked off the House impeachment inquiry this fall -- Tlaib said on camera at a Capitol Hill reception celebrating the new Congress that \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in there and we\u2019re going to impeach the motherf---er,\u201d referring to Trump. \u201cNothing was going to get in their way and certainly not the truth,\u201d McCarthy began Wednesday. \u201cMadam Speaker, Chairman Schiff said he had evidence, more than circumstantial, of collusion. That was false.  \u201cIn January, where we all stood in this body. We stood up. We raised our hands. We swore that we\u2019d uphold the Constitution,\u201d McCarthy continued. \u201cAnd, a few mere hours after that, Congresswoman Tlaib said she was going to impeach the mother-f-er. Those are not my words.\u201d Omar also commented on Twitter on\u00a0Wednesday about the impeachment. \u201cThe evidence is clear,\" she wrote online. \"Trump extorted a foreign government in an effort to get reelected -- and obstructed Congress\u2019 resulting investigation. He abused his oath of office. Today, I will act to restore balance to our democracy. I will vote to impeach Donald Trump.\u201d Other Squad members shared their views Wednesday as well. During her own floor speech, Tlaib pointed to the \u201ccommon sense\u201d of the people in her home district in Michigan and veterans\u2019 sense of \u201cduty and responsibly\u201d before citing \u201cbribery\u201d as a reason she supported\u00a0impeaching Trump -- even though bribery was not included as an article of impeachment.  The Democrat-led House decided to file only two articles \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\u00a0Article one, abuse of power, passed on a\u00a0230-197 vote, with two Democrats joining Republicans in voting nay. The obstruction-of-Congress vote was 229-197, with three Democrats voting nay.\u00a0No Republicans supported either article. \u201cI rise today in support of impeachment. I learn so much every single day from my residents at home. Their common sense and understanding of what is right and wrong centered on why they oppose any person who uses the most powerful position in the world for personal gain,\u201d Tlaib said.  \u201cWe honor our veterans in this chamber almost on a daily basis, but do we ever follow their lead? Where we serve the people of the United States and uphold the Constitution not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans. We should learn from their sense of duty and responsibility to country and democracy -- not a political party. \u201cDoing nothing here, Madam Speaker, is not an option. Looking away from these crimes against our country is not an option. This is about protecting the future of our nation and our democracy from corruption. Abuse of power, criminal cover-ups and bribery.  \u201cThis vote is also for my sons and the future of so many generations, so I urge my colleagues to please vote yes on these articles of impeachment,\u201d she concluded.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took aim at Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., who \u2013 invoking the holiday season \u2013 used his speech on the House floor Wednesday to point out that the Romans who persecuted Jesus Christ first gave him a chance to defend himself.  \"Before you take this historic vote today, one week before Christmas, I want you to keep this in mind: When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this President in this process,\" Loudermilk said.  Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter with a Bible verse, simply writing: \u201cRomans 1:25\u201d The verse warns against changing the \u201ctruth of God into a lie\u201d and instead of worshipping a \u201ccreature\u201d more than the blessed Creator -- in what appeared to be a comment from the congresswoman on Republicans' support for President Trump. House Democrats had\u00a0pointed out that Trump was invited to testify before Congress but refused to comply with the impeachment inquiry.  \"No normal person would be able to get away with attempting to extort a foreign power to compromise our country,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Wednesday. \u201cBut all too often, the most corrupt and powerful people grow so accustomed to life with impunity that standard accountability feels to them like unjust persecution.\u201d  Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.,\u00a0 also addresssed her fellow\u00a0House members on Wednesday.  \u201cI rise today to protect our democracy. Today we take a stand against corruption and abuses of power.

The White House said Tuesday that the president will sign the bill. The legislation gives Trump a victory on his U.S.-Mexico border fence and gives Democrats domestic spending increases and an expensive repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health plans. It provides health care and pension benefits for retired coal miners and increases the nationwide legal age to buy tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21.

The split-their-differences legislation was carrying a large number of unrelated provisions into law, drawing protests from fiscal conservatives.

However, Trump may use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount.

Popular programs such as health research, veterans' medical care, NASA, sewer and water projects, and law enforcement grants to state and local governments would also get increases under the package.

The five defendants are charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes from one cooperating witness in the form of campaign contributions, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. In return, the officials promised the cooperating witness, who is a tax attorney, they would vote or use their office of influence to hire or continue to hire his law firm for lucrative government legal work. The defendants include Sudhan Thomas, incumbent Jersey City school board president, and former State Assemblyman Jason O\u2019Donnell, who ran an unsuccessful campaign to be\u00a0mayor of Bayonne in 2018. Some of the multi-thousand-dollar bribes came in envelopes or paper bags filled with cash -- or, in one case, a coffee cup stuffed with cash -- and were delivered to the defendants by the tax attorney at restaurants, parking lots, a political fundraiser and a campaign headquarters. Thomas was charged with accepting $35,000 in cash bribes, with\u00a0$10,000 delivered in one instance and $25,000 delivered on another date. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrant-drivers-licenses-phil-murphy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NEW JERSEY GOV.

His misconduct took place between May and July 2019. Thomas lost his bid for re-election to the Jersey City School Board in November. O\u2019Donnell, former state assemblyman, is charged with accepting a $10,000 bribe.

On Tuesday, the Biden campaign released a statement from Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as White House physician to Biden for several years. \"Vice President Biden is a healthy, vigorous 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those as chief executive, head of state\u00a0and commander in chief,\u201d Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor said. In his report, O\u2019Connor said that Biden is currently being treated for non-valvular atrial-fibrillation, better known as Afib, which is an irregular heartbeat. He said Biden is also being treated for hyperlipidemia, which is an abnormally high concentration of fats or lipids in the blood, as well as gastroesophageal reflux, a digestive disorder that occurs when acidic stomach juices, or food and fluids, back up from the stomach into the esophagus.

The judge broke up the speech and called the attorneys for both Mynetts to the bench and put on sound to drown out their conversations. Then the court hearing abruptly ended without a formal announcement of adjournment. Both parties left with their lawyers and declined comment. A court clerk came into the hallways afterward with paperwork looking for the Mynetts but was surprised to find them already long gone. Both Tim Mynett, a political consultant, and Omar have denied any\u00a0affair. The divorce case had been rescheduled at least two times prior. The late-morning hearing at the family division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\u00a0was delayed as both Mynetts and their\u00a0lawyers huddled in a private room to work out the terms of the settlement. Important to Beth Mynett was that Tim withdraw his counterclaim where he denied the affair with Omar,\u00a0said he had \u201cbeen unhappy for the better part\" of his relationship with his wife, and accused her of launching a \u201cnegative campaign\u201d to ruin his career and damage his relationship with their son and his stepdaughter. While the details of the settlement were not immediately available, courtroom discussion Thursday seemed to indicate the agreement included such a withdrawal. Lawyers for both sides had also worked out an agreement resolving all the issues of custody, finances and attorney fees. Both Mynetts had signed off on the settlement paperwork and told the court\u00a0they will abide by the terms. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tlaib-video-excited-impeachment\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TRUMP CALLS OUT RASHIDA TLAIB FOR POSTING VIDEO OF HERSELF EXCITEDLY WALKING TO IMPEACHMENT VOTE</strong></a> But it wasn't over.\u00a0As Tim Mynett waited inside the courtroom, Beth Mynett sat outside in the hallway and read aloud from her phone --\u00a0apparent practice for\u00a0her courtroom speech. Around 12:30 p.m., the Mynetts appeared before Soltys\u00a0for a brief hearing to have the settlement finalized. Soltys\u00a0asked both parties a series of questions, including whether Beth Mynett thought there was any hope for reconciliation. \u201cAbsolutely, not,\u201d she said. Mynett also wanted to have her former\u00a0name restored. \u201cI no longer want to have Mr. Mynett\u2019s name attached to me,\u201d Beth explained. The judge then asked if Tim Mynett disagrees with anything\u00a0his spouse said: \"I do not,\" he said. Soltys signed off on all the paperwork. \u201cSo that takes care of everything. The divorce is now final,\u201d Soltys declared roughly 10 minutes into the court hearing. Soltys then\u00a0praised the Mynetts for the smooth settlement when too often parents have prolonged court fights. She gave the\u00a0pair kudos for hashing out the details of their divorce settlement behind the scenes and working to co-parent their child. \u201cYou should be real pleased with yourself,\u201d the judge said. Then just as the hearing was to wrap up,\u00a0Beth Mynett spoke up. She wanted to let the court know under threat of \u201cperjury\u201d that it was \u201cappropriate and just\u201d that her ex withdrew\u00a0his \"false\" counterclaim against her. She went on to say she was \"devoted\" to her marriage and her husband indeed had \"happiness\"\u00a0during their 13 years together and seven years of marriage. But her speech was cut short after mentioning Tim Mynett's alleged affair with Omar. Tim Mynett worked for Omar and his business, E Street Group, got $370,000 of her campaign funds,\u00a0<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/ilhan-omar-funneled-another-150k-to-alleged-lovers-consulting-group/\" target=\"_blank\">according to The New York Post</a>, which broke the news of the initial divorce filing.
